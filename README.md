# README

EventBrite is a full-stack application that is a clone of Eventbrite. For this project I used Rails and PostgreSQL as my backend and React/Redux as my frontend.

This application allows a user to browse events, create, update and delete
events, browse categories, browse events by categories, purchase tickets to events, and create and account.

Here is a link to the design documents that laid out the foundation for my app: [Production Wiki](https://github.com/alexg622/Event_Bright/wiki)
