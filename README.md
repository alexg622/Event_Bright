# README

BrightEvent is a full-stack application that is a clone of Eventbrite. For this project I used Rails and PostgreSQL as my backend, and React/Redux as my frontend.

This application allows a user to browse, create, update and delete
events, browse categories, browse events by category, purchase tickets to events, and create an account.

Here is a link to the design documents that laid out the foundation for my application: [Production Wiki](https://github.com/alexg622/Event_Bright/wiki)

# Key Features

## User Authentication

Users can create an account by signing up and entering their credentials. After signing up users can log in, create, update and delete events. Alternatively, a user can also sign in or sign up with a demo account.

## Home Page

The home page feature events that the user can browse through and click on to view the event details. The user also has access to the nav bar which allows a user to browse events by category.

## Event Show Page

The event show pages shows the user all the details of an event including its title, author, price, location, and date. It also allows the user who created the event to update or delete it. Users will also be able to purchase tickets on this page as well.
