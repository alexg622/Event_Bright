# 1. this.state won't work on update_event_container only this.props.event

# 2. value won't set in new event for category drop down

# 3. can't get multiple categories for new event

# When I click on the show page from the index the console keeps going

# why when I delete an event I have to refresh the page for it to go away

# why do I need to refresh the page for the delete button to show up.
